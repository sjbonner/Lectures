## Example 21.1
   The simplest possible joint distribution is that for two Bernoulli random variables. Suppose that $X$ and $Y$ take the values $0$ and $1$ according to the following joint pmf:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|cccc}
$x$ & \multicolumn{2}{c}{0} & \multicolumn{2}{c}{1}\\
$y$ & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1\\
\hline
$p(x,y)$ & $p_{00}$ & $p_{01}$ & $p_{10}$ & $p_{11}$.
\end{tabular}
\end{center}


a) What is the expected value of $XY$?
b) What are the covariance and correlation of $X$ and $Y$?
c) What are the mean and variance of $Z=2X + 4Y$?
d) Under what conditions are $X$ and $Y$ independent? What is are the mean $XY$ in this case?

## Example 21.2

Each of the following plots represents the joint pmf of two random variables, $X$ and $Y$. The points, $(x,y)$ represent the possible values of $(X,Y)$. The distribution places equal probability, $1/6$, at each point.

\begin{tabular}{cc}
\includegraphics[width=.4\textwidth]{../Slides/figure/exercise-26-2-4} &
\includegraphics[width=.4\textwidth]{../Slides/figure/exercise-26-2-2} \\
\includegraphics[width=.4\textwidth]{../Slides/figure/exercise-26-2-1} &
\includegraphics[width=.4\textwidth]{../Slides/figure/exercise-26-2-3} \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

## Exercise 21.1

Consider rolling two fair, three-sided die. Let $S$ denote the sum of the values showing on the two die and $D$ the absolute value of the difference. E.g., if one die shows the value 1 and the second shows the value 2 then $S=3$ and $D=1$, regardless of which was thrown first.

a) Construct a table showing the joint pmf of $S$ and $D$. 
b) Compute the marginal pmf of both $S$ and $D$. 
c) Compute the expected value and variance of $S$ and $D$.
d) Compute the covariance and correlation of $S$ and $D$. 
e) Are $S$ and $D$ independent? Justify your answer.
