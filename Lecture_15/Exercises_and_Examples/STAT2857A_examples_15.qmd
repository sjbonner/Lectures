## Example 15.1

 Consider the random variable, $X$, from Example 14.1. This random variable represents the distance that an object dropped from a height of 1~m falls in a randomly selected time between 0 and 1 second on the home planet of Emperor Zurg where the force of gravity is only 2~m/s$^2$. The pdf and cdf are

$$
        f(x)=\left\{
          \begin{array}{ll}
            0 \leq 0\\
            2x & 0 < x < 1\\
          0 & 1 \leq x
          \end{array}
        \right.
        \mbox{ and }
        F(x)=\int_{-\infty}^x f(u)~du=
        \left\{
          \begin{array}{ll}
            0 & x \leq 0\\
            x^2 & 0 < x < 1\\
            1 & 1 \leq x
          \end{array}
        \right.
$$
  
a) Find the mean of $X$.
b) Compute the variance of $X$.
c) Provide an interpretation for the mean.
d) Let $Y$ be the distance traveled in inches not metres ($Y=39.37X$). Find the mean and variance of $Y$.
e) Let $Z=X^2$. Find the mean and variance of $Z$. 

## Exercise 15.2

Suppose that the random variable $X$ has pdf
$$
f(x)=\frac{3}{4}\left[2x-x^2\right],\quad 0 \leq x \leq 2.
$$


a) Confirm that $f(x)$ is a valid pdf.
b) Find the mean and variance of $X$.
c) Find the mean and variance of $Y=3X+2$.
d) Find the mean and variance of $Z=X^2$.
