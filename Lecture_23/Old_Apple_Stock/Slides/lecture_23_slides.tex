    Suppose that the change in the stock price per day is normal with constant mean and variance.  
    \begin{enumerate}[a)]
    \item What is the probability that the stock price increases on a randomly selected day?
    \item What is the probability that the stock price decreases on a randomly selected day?
    \item Suppose that you buy stock on 10 randomly selected days and sell them back one day later each time.
     \begin{enumerate}[i)]
        \item What is your expected gain/loss?
        \item What is the probability that the stock price increases on at least half of the days?

  Does this improve your chance of making a profit?
