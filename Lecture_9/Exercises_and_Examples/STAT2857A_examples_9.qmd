## Example 9.2

Approximately 79\% of the world's population has brown eyes\footnote{\url{https://www.worldatlas.com}}.

Suppose that we sample 5 people from the population at random with replacement and record their eye-colour as brown or not brown. Let $X$ represent the number of people in our sample with brown eyes.

a) Compute the expected value of $X$. 
b) Compute the variance of $X$.
c) Compute the standard deviation of $X$.
d) Provide an interpretation for $E(X)$.

## Example 9.3

Approximately 79\% of the world's population has brown eyes.

Suppose that we sample 5 people from the population at random with replacement and record their eye-colour as brown or not brown. Let $Y$ represent the number of brown eyes in the sample plus the number of hands\footnote{We'll assume that everyone has two of each}.

a) Compute the expected value of $Y$. 
b) Compute the variance of $Y$.
c) Compute the standard deviation of $Y$.
d) Provide an interpretation for $E(Y)$.

## Exercise 9.1

 A professor driving to Western must pass through 5 sets of traffic lights. There is a .75 percent chance of being stopped at each light (or so it appears to him). The time it takes him to complete the drive is 15 minutes plus 3 minutes for each light he has to stop at. 

Let $X$ be the number of lights he must stop at and $Y$ the time it takes him in minutes.

a) Compute the expected value, variance, and standard deviation of $X$.
b) Provide an interpretation for the expected value.
c) Compute the expected value, variance, and standard deviation of $Y$.
